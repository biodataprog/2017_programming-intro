# Syllabus for GEN220: High Throughput Biological Data Processing

Course Description
==================

This course focuses on computational skills for processing data using
programming language Python and UNIX environment. No prior programming
experience is required, but some basic computer skills will be useful.

With the advancement of high throughput data generation methods, a
major challenge that graduate students in life sciences have to face
today is to analyze large amount of biological data. The objective of
this course is to provide an opportunity for graduate students with no
computer science background to learn the basic skills of handling high
throughput biological data. It covers the Linux/Unix environment and
the importance of the command line interface; the Python programming
language; program design, implementation, and testing; BioPython;
Strategies for analyzing genome resequencing, RNASeq, sequencing data.
Students build hands-on skills by analyzing real high throughput
biological data through homework assignments and team projects.

Grading
-------

* Programming Homework assignments (5 in total): 50%

* Team project: 50% 

Homework
--------


* There will be a programming assignment every two weeks. Programming
   assignments must be prepared along with any necessary input files or documentation to demonstrate program usage.
      
* Code should be runnable as turned in. You will deposit your code in
  your github repository or if not possible, by iLearn. You can make
  one private personal repository to deposit and should organize a
  folder for each homework assignment (e.g. hw1, hw2, hw3).

* Homework is due BEFORE class on the Wednesdays it is due. The next
  homework will be posted on Friday at latest.

Projects
--------

* Topics to be selected from a set of choices or the team's choosing
  (with approval from instructor). Selection of topics will occur by
  end of October.

* Project teams will be 2-3 individuals working together.

* A presentation will be made by each team - last day(s) of class.

* A final report with the details will be turned in by the group.

* The report needs to detail what each person's contribution is to the
  project.
