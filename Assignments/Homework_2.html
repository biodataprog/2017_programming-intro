<h1 id="homework-2-python-basics">Homework 2: Python Basics</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Write a python program called <code>print_triples.py</code></strong>. Print out all the numbers from 0 to 100 and print a * next to the numbers which are perfectly divisible by 3.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Do this by making a loop which counts up from 0..100</li>
<li>Check the number to see if it is divisible perfectly by 3 (no remainder)</li>
<li>Print a <code>*</code> next to the number if that is the case</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Output should look some like</strong></dt>
<dd><pre><code>0
1
2
3 *
4
5
6 *</code></pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Write a replacement for the unix tool word count: <code>wc</code>.</strong> The program should print out the number of lines in an input file - store your code in the script <code>wc.py</code>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Bonus for the more advanced</em> - also print out the number words and characters found in the file.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Read in the codon table file and print some specific patterns.</strong> The file is <code>codon_table_compact.txt</code> and is provided in the homework template you will get when you clone the repository. It is also available <a href="https://biodataprog.github.io/programming-intro/data/codon_table_compact.txt">codon_table_compact.txt</a>. This file has 3 columns which list the 3 letter codon, the amino acid abbreviation, and the full amino acid name. Your program will be written in the script <code>codon_table_count.py</code></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For each amino acid, print out the number of codons which code for it</li>
<li>Print out the total number of amino acids and codons seen.</li>
<li>Print out the number of Amino acids which are four-fold degerate (are encoded by 4 or more codons). Also print out these amino acids at the end.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>The report can look something like:</dt>
<dd><pre><code>Amino acid X is encoded by Y codons
...
...
===
There are X total amino acids and X codons
There are X AAs which are four-fold or six-fold degenerate
These AAs are:
  X
  Y
  Z</code></pre>
