Class Projects
==============
1. _MutMapper_ - Identify transposon, EMS, or UV induced mutations in a
   strain as compared to a reference genome. *Beth, Daniel*

2. _Transcriptomicon / RNAseq_ - Develop a pipeline for processing raw RNAseq,
  assembling into transcripts, identifying ORFs, and extracting
  genes which have long UTRs, features. *Amanda, Mari, Madison, Tierney*

3.  _Phylotantrum / Gene Tree_ -  Build a pipeline to take a single gene sequence
   (protein) and identify homologs, align these, trim, and build gene
   trees. Refine tree or alignment to remove outliers and build a
   final gene alignment and Tree. *Laura, Luke, Sam, Stephanie*

4. _Selectionable Gene Trees_ - Selection identification by dN/dS analysis of paralogs/orthologys. *Kaleigh,Josh*

5. _INDELible_ - Taking population genomic resequencing data, identify
   insertion/deletion patterns across a genome. Are there non random
   distributions of indel size across a chromosome? Generate
   reports/interactive view of indel sizes and sequence preferences. _Glen,Chris_

6. _Microbiomifcation_16Ssss_ - Process 16S data to ask questions about OTU picking and
   mapping to better custom databases *Hannah,Nicole,Nat,Julia*

7. _ProteinStatsClassify_ - Protein statistics from protein. Can develop a classifier for outlier proteins and/or ecological adaptations (thermophillic vs halophillic). Using Bacteria and Fungal sequences. *Jesus*
