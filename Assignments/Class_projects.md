Project Ideas for Class projects


1. _MutMapper_ - Identify transposon, EMS, or UV induced mutations in a
   strain as compared to a reference genome.

2. _Transcriptomicon_ - Develop a pipeline for processing raw RNAseq,
  assemnbling into transcripts, identifying ORFs, and extracting
  genes which have long UTRs, features.

3. _Phylotantrum_ - Build a pipeline to take a single gene sequence
   (protein) and identify homologs, align these, trim, and build gene
   trees. Refine tree or alignment to remove outliers and build a
   final gene alignment and Tree.

4. _INDELible_ - Taking population genomic resequencing data, identify
   insertion/deletion patterns across a genome. Are there non random
   distributions of indel size across a chromosome? Generate
   reports/interactive view of indel sizes and sequence preferences.
